You'll do these in your browser and type code and see results there.\n\nIt seems like there are a lot, but they're short and go fairly quickly (especially as you get the hang of the `ggplot()` syntax). Complete these:\n\n- **Visualize Data**\n  - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.1)\n  - [Bar Charts](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.2)\n  - [Histograms](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.3)\n  - [Boxplots and Counts](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.4)\n  - [Scatterplots](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.5)\n  - [Line plots](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.6)\n  - [Overplotting and Big Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.7)\n  - [Customize Your Plots](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.8)\n\n\n## Part 2: Reshaping data with {tidyr}\n\nFor the last part of this week's lesson, you'll work through just one RStudio primer to learn how to use the {tidyr} package to reshape data from wide to long and back to wide.\n\nComplete this:\n\n- **Tidy Your Data**\n  - [Reshape Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4.1)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Pivoting\n\nNewer versions of {tidyr} have renamed these core functions: `gather()` is now `pivot_longer()` and `spread()` is now `pivot_wider()`. The syntax for these `pivot_*()` functions is *slightly* different from what it was in `gather()` and `spread()`, so you can't just replace the names. Fortunately, both `gather()` and `spread()` still work and won't go away for a while, so you can still use them as you learn about reshaping and tidying data. It would be worth learning how the newer `pivot_*()` functions work, eventually, though ([see here for examples](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html)).\n:::\n",
