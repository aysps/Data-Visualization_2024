You can actually format R code on Slack if you click on the little lightning icon in the bottom left of the typing area and search for \"text snippet\"—that'll open a dialog that will let you paste in text and add R syntax highlighting. You can also paste your code between triple backticks on Slack and it'll format it in monospaced font (though not with the neat syntax highlighting that you get when using Slack's text snippet thing):\n\n\t````default\n\t```\n\tggplot(blah) + geom_point()\n\t```\n\t````\n\n\tYou can also take screenshots to *supplement* your question (use ⌘+shift+4 on macOS to save a screenshot to your Desktop, or ⌘+⌥+shift+4 to save a screenshot directly to the clipboard; use Windows+shift+S on Windows to save a screenshot directly to the clipboard). Do not send a screenshot as your entire question though (it's very tempting to just post a picture of an error and hope that someone can fix it)—provide context. Screenshots are helpful, but code/text is better—it's harder for people to get the code out of a screenshot in Slack and into RStudio on their computer to troubleshoot, since you can't copy/paste from an image.\n\n3.

It is very tempting to send me private messages on Slack for assistance, and that's great and I'm happy to respond like that. However, one way to help [build a stronger community](/news/2023-08-21_building-community.qmd) for this class is to ask questions in public in the different `#help` channels instead. There are a couple reasons for this:\n\n   - **It reduces duplication**: Many of you will have almost identical questions and I often end up copying and pasting my answers between different private conversations asking for help. Having those questions and answers in the public `#help` channels instead will let you get answers to common questions faster\n   - **It allows *you* to help**: Some of you have R experience already, and even if you don't, as the semester goes on, you'll get more comfortable with it and will start being able to answer your classmates' questions. You might have just fixed a similar issue in a past exercise, or you might be able to spot a typo in their code, or you might otherwise know how to help. Step in and help!

I've had past students tell me that's like the one thing they'll remember from my classes—do not suffer in silence.
