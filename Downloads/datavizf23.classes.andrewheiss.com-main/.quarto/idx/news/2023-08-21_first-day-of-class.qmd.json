This is where all the class materials live and it's the official source of dates and all other class information. I only use iCollege for collecting your assignments and posting answer keys (since it's password protected). Because it's not part of iCollege, you'll be able to reference it even after you graduate and lose access to GSU resources. You can even share it with others—it's just a website!

Since this is a summer class, we're covering two sessions a week. You'll follow this general process for each session:\n\n\t1. Go to the content page, read the readings, and watch the slides/lectures\n\t2. Go to the lesson page and do the lessons\n\t3.

This is the best and fastest place to get help and talk to me and your classmates during the semester. I’ll also post general tips and tricks and advice there, so check it regularly.\n\n- In addition to the lessons, examples, and assignments, [I've included a bunch of extra resources on the class website](/resource/index.qmd) - check out those different pages for extra links to things about graphic design, data visualization, R, R best practices, data, and lots of other things.\n\nCool cool cool, let's go!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nHi everyone!\n\nToday's the first day of class, and I'm excited to get started!\n\nA few quick reminders:\n\n- If you haven't yet, please visit the class website at <https://datavizf23.classes.andrewheiss.com/>.
