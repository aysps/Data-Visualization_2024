Here we go!\n\n\n\nDon’t wait until you’ve finished typing your entire document before knitting. Knit to HTML occasionally to make sure all your code runs from a fresh session and to make sure all the extra warnings and messages and any other strange output is taken care of.\n\nEven if your final document won’t be an HTML file, I recommend knitting to HTML often because (1) it’s fast and (2) you can see the output in an easily-refreshable web browser immediately. When you knit to PDF, you have to wait a few extra seconds for LaTeX to compile the rendered Markdown file into PDF, and then you have to reopen the PDF file if you had it open previously. When you knit to Word, if you have a previous version of the .docx file open already, your computer will get mad (especially on Windows), so you have to remember to always close the knitted document in Word before reknitting it, and that’s annoying and you’ll inevitably forget.\n\nSo knit to HTML often. Then at the end, once you know everything is working right and the document looks nice and clean, knit to PDF or Word or whatever your final output will be.\n\n\n### Check that your text looks okay\n\nWhen knitting, you should also check your text to make sure it looks okay. Here are some common issues that you’ll see with your text:\n\n#### Headings that aren’t headings\n\nOften you’ll want to make a heading for one of your sections and you’ll type this:\n\n``` default\n#Task 1: Reflection\n```\n\nWhen you knit that, though, it’ll look like this:\n\n> #Task 1: Reflection\n\nThat’s not a heading—that’s just a regular paragraph. For a `#`-style heading to turn into an actual heading, you need a space after the `#` and an empty line after the heading text:\n\n``` default\n# Task 1: Reflection\n\nSome text\n\n## A subheading\n\nSome more text\n```\n\n#### Paragraphs that aren’t paragraphs\n\nYou’re used to indenting paragraphs in Word or Google Docs. First-line indentation is a normal thing with word processors.\n\nIndenting lines is **unnecessary** with Markdown and will mess up your text.\n\nFor example, let’s say you type something like this:\n\n``` default\n    It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of \nwisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the \nepoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, \nit was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything \nbefore us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were \nall going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present \nperiod, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, \nfor good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n\n    There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the \nthrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair \nface, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to \nthe lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general \nwere settled for ever. \n```\n\nThat looks like Word-style text, with indented paragraphs. When you knit it, though, it’ll turn into code-formatted monospaced text that runs off the edge of the page:\n\n>     It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n>\n>     There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. \n\nThat’s because Markdown treats anything that is indented with four spaces as *code*, not as text.\n\n**You shouldn’t indent your text.** Instead, add an empty line between each paragraph to separate them.\n\n\n#### Lists that aren’t lists\n\nDue to esoteric historical reasons, the end of lines (i.e. what happens when you press <kbd>enter</kbd> when typing) is different on Macs and Windows. I use a Mac, and I typed the exercise templates on a Mac, so they have Mac-style line endings. That means that on Windows, you’ll sometimes see text that looks normal like this:\n\n``` default\n- Here's a list\n- Stuff goes here\n- Neato\n```\n\nThat should theoretically turn into a list, but when you knit it, you see this:\n\n> - Here’s a list - Stuff goes here - Neato\n\nThat’s not a list! The easiest way to fix that is to delete the line break at the end of “list” in that first line and then press enter (and so on), so that it turns in to this when knitting:\n\n> - Here's a list\n> - Stuff goes here\n> - Neato\n\n\n### Don’t install packages in your document\n\nMake sure you don't include code to install packages in your Rmd files. Like, don't include `install.packages(\"ggtext\")` or whatever. If you do, R will reinstall that package every time you knit your document, which is excessive. All you need to do is load the package with `library()`\n\nTo help myself remember to not include package installation code in my document, I make an effort to either install packages with my mouse by clicking on the “Install” button in the Packages panel in RStudio, or only ever typing (or copying/pasting) code like `install.packages(\"whatever\")` directly in the R console and never putting it in a chunk.\n\n\n### Clean up warnings and messages\n\nIdeally, your document shouldn’t have any errors, warnings, or messages in it. Some packages are talkative, like {tidyverse}:\n\n```{r load-libraries}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nSome functions are talkative, like `summarize()` after working on more than one group:\n\n```{r mpg-grp-summarize}\nmpg %>% \n  group_by(year, drv) %>% \n  summarize(avg = mean(hwy))\n```\n\nOr `geom_smooth()`:\n\n```{r mpg-smooth}\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n```\n\nWhen you have code that you know will return some sort of message, add `message=FALSE` to the chunk options for it. When you have code that you know will make some sort of warning, (1) try to fix it so that the warning doesn’t happen, or (2) add `warning=FALSE` to the chunk options for it.\n\n```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n#| echo: fenced\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nKnitting often and scrolling through the rendered document will help you check that you don’t have any extra output like warnings, messages, and errors too.\n\n\n### Global chunk options\n\nYou can control the settings for all the chunks in your document by using `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`. You can use any knitr chunk options (see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) or [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) for a complete list).\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Let R make the code for you\n\nI never remember the full name of that function, but you can get it if you go to “File \\> New File \\> R Markdown”; it’s part of the Rmd template RStudio makes for you.\n:::\n\nFor instance, if you want to hide all the code in your document, you could either go add `echo=FALSE` to each chunk individually, or you could add it to the global chunk options:\n\n``` r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\n```\n\nYou could hide all warnings and messages there too:\n\n``` r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)\n```\n\n***BUT*** I don’t recommend doing that ↑ normally. Warnings are helpful—when you get them, you’ll typically want to try to deal with them. Instead of hiding them, try to fix them. If you can’t fix them (like when you run `library(tidyverse)`), then you can hide them for that chunk.\n\nYou can also set default figure dimensions and lots of other settings. I typically include something like this at the start of my documents:\n\n``` r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  fig.width = 6, \n  fig.height = 6 * 0.618,  # Golden rectangles!\n  fig.align = \"center\", \n  out.width = \"80%\"\n)\n```\n\nMake sure you hide the chunk that contains those settings with something like `include=FALSE`, otherwise you’ll see it in your document:\n\n````\n```{{r document-chunk-options, include=FALSE}}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  fig.width = 6, \n  fig.height = 6 * 0.618,  # Golden rectangles!\n  fig.align = \"center\", \n  out.width = \"80%\"\n)\n```\n````\n\n\n### Fancy document settings\n\nYou can make your documents prettier by changing the settings for different outputs ([see this for complete documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html)).\n\nFor example, if you want a different font in PDFs, you can include something like this in your frontmatter. [See here for complete details.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)\n\n````yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Whatever\"\ndate: \"Whatever\"\noutput:\n  pdf_document:\n    latex_engine: xelatex  # This lets LaTeX work with different fonts\nmainfont: Garamond\nfontsize: 10pt\n---\n````\n\nIf you want a different template for HTML ([you can use these](https://bootswatch.com/3/), or if you know HTML and CSS, you can make your own), you can do something like this. [See here for complete details.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)\n\n````yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Whatever\"\ndate: \"Whatever\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme: united\n---\n````\n\nYou can't do much with Word because Microsoft makes it hard to do anything to .docx files, but you can create a .docx file where you define a bunch of style settings (e.g., make Heading 1 a specific sans serif font, left-aligned, bold; make Heading 2 the same font and not bold; make main paragraphs an 11pt serif font; and so on), and then you can inject those styles into the knitted document like this. [See here for complete details.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/word-document.html)\n\n````yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Whatever\"\ndate: \"Whatever\"\noutput:\n  word_document:\n    reference_docx: my-neat-styles.docx\n---\n````\n\nYou can keep all those output-specific settings in the same document—knitr will only use the settings required for each output (i.e. if you knit to PDF it'll ignore the HTML settings):\n\n````yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Whatever\"\ndate: \"Whatever\"\noutput:\n  pdf_document:\n    latex_engine: xelatex  # This lets LaTeX work with different fonts\n  html_document:\n    theme: united\n  word_document:\n    reference_docx: my-neat-styles.docx\nmainfont: Garamond\nfontsize: 10pt\n---\n````\n\nYou can get really fancy with this stuff. For example, [this Rmd file](https://github.com/andrewheiss/cautioning-canary/blob/master/manuscript/manuscript.Rmd) creates four different kinds of customized output ([see here](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/cautioning-canary/)):\n\n- [PDF](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/cautioning-canary/output/manuscript.pdf)\n- [Manuscripty PDF](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/cautioning-canary/output/manuscript-ms.pdf)\n- [HTML](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/cautioning-canary/output/manuscript.html)\n- [Word](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/cautioning-canary/output/manuscript.docx)\n\n\n### Quarto\n\nIf you want even fancier documents, try the next generation of R Markdown called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It makes it a billion times easier to do things like change fonts, use cross references (i.e. write things like \"see Figure 1\" or \"see Table 3\"), use citations (automatic APA or Chicago citation styles!), use fancier layouts, and so on.\n\nThis course website is built with Quarto. Check out this for an example of an academic paper written with Quarto:\n\n- [.qmd file](https://github.com/andrewheiss/mountainous-mackerel/blob/main/manuscript/manuscript.qmd)\n- [PDF, manuscripty PDF, and HTML output for that .qmd file](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/mountainous-mackerel/analysis/paper.html)\n\n[Quarto has great documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/), it's fully supported in RStudio already, and you basically already know how to use it. It's just .Rmd with fancier, newer features.\n\n\n### Chunk names\n\n[Labeling your R chunks is a good thing to do](/resource/rmarkdown.qmd#chunk-names), since it helps with document navigation and is generally good practice. If you're using chunk labels **make sure you don't use spaces** in them. R will still knit a document with spaceful names, but it converts the spaces to underscores before doing it. So instead of naming chunks like `{r My Neat Chunk, message=FALSE}`, use something like `{r my-neat-chunk}` or `{r my_neat_chunk}`.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  fig.width = 6, \n  fig.height = 6 * 0.618, \n  fig.align = \"center\", \n  out.width = \"90%\",\n  collapse = TRUE\n)\n```\n\nHi everyone!\n\nWith mini project 1 coming up, I have a bunch of helpful tips to make sure your documents look as nice and readable as possible.

my_neat_chunk}`.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"highlight-style":"monokai","toc-depth":5,"output-file":"2023-10-03_cleaner-nicer-rmd-output.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
