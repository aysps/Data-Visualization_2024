Choose whatever one you are most interested in or will have the most fun with.\n\n\n[Go to this list of data sources](/resource/data.qmd) and find something interesting! The things in the \"Data is Plural\" newsletter are often especially interesting and fun. Here are some different high-quality datasets that students have worked with before:\n\n### Nonprofit management\n\n- [U.S. Charities and Non-profits](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/us-charities-and-nonprofits): All of the charities and nonprofits registered with the IRS. This is actually split into six separate files. You can combine them all into one massive national database with `bind_rows()`, or filter the data to include specific states (or a single state). It all depends on the story you're telling.

Source: [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data/resource/ceb00cff-443d-4d43-b17a-ee13437e9564).\n- [Firefighter Fatalities in the United States](https://www.kaggle.com/fema/firefighter-fatalities): Name, rank, and cause of death for all firefighters killed since 2000.

Source: Booking.com.\n- [Chase Bank Branch Deposits, 2010–2016](https://www.kaggle.com/chasebank/bank-deposits): Records for every branch of Chase Bank in the United States. This dataset is not quite tidy and will require a little bit of reshaping with `pivot_longer()`, since there are individual columns of deposits per year. Source: Chase Bank. \n\n\n## Instructions\n\nHere's what you'll need to do:\n\n1. **Download** a dataset and explore it. Many of these datasets are large and will not open (well) in Excel, so you'll need to load the CSV file into R with `read_csv()`. Most of these datasets have nice categorical variables that you can use for grouping and summarizing, and many have time components too, so you can look at trends. Your past problem sets and in-class examples will come in handy here.\n\n2. **Find** a story in the data. Explore that story and make sure it's true and insightful.\n\n3. Use R to **create** multiple graphs to tell the story. You can make as many graphs as you want, but you must use at least **three** different chart types (i.e. don't just make three scatterplots or three maps). \n\n4. Export these figures as PDF files, place them in a [vector editing program](/resource/graphics-editors.html), and **make** one combined graphic or handout where you tell the complete story. You have a lot of latitude in how you do this. You can make a graphic-heavy one-page handout. You can make something along the lines of the [this](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nuclear-power-reactors-global), with one big graphic + smaller subgraphics + explanatory text. Just don't make a [goofy infographic](https://medium.com/@kazarnowicz/why-infographics-are-bad-3a2fa49673e2). Whatever you do, the final figure must include all the graphics, must have some explanatory text to help summarize the narrative, and must be well designed.\n\n5. **Export** the final graphic from Illustrator as a PDF and a PNG.\n\n6. **Write** a memo using R Markdown to introduce, frame, and describe your story and figure. [Use this template to get started](/files/projects/your_name_finalproject.Rmd). You should include the following in the memo:\n\n   - Executive summary\n   - Background information and summary of the data\n   - Explanation, description, and code for each individual figure\n   - Explanation and description for the final figure\n   - Final figure should be included as an image (remember `![Caption goes here](path/to/file.png)`)\n\nRemember to follow R Markdown etiquette rules and style—don't have it output extraneous messages or warnings, include summary tables in nice tables, adjust the dimensions for your figures, and remove the placeholder text that's in the template already (i.e. I don't want to see stuff like \"Describe and show how you cleaned and reshaped the data\" in the final report.)\n\n**You should [download a full example of what a final project might look like](/projects/example_final.zip)** (but don't make your final combined visualization look exactly like this—show some creativity!)\n\n\n## Final deliverables\n\nUpload the following files to iCollege:\n\n1. A memo introducing and describing your final graphic (see full instructions above)\n2. A standalone PDF of your graphic exported from Illustrator\n3. A standalone PNG of your graphic exported from Illustrator\n\n**No late work will be accepted for this project since it's the last project and it counts as your final.**\n\nI will use [this rubric](/files/projects/final-project-rubric.xlsx) to grade the final product:\n\n- [{{< fa file-excel >}} `final-project-rubric.xlsx`](/files/projects/final-project-rubric.xlsx)\n\nI am happy to give feedback and help along the way—please don't hesitate to get help!
