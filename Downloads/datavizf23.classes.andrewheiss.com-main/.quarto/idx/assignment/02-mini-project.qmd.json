Open that new folder in Windows File Explorer or macOS Finder (however you navigate around the files on your computer), and create two subfolders there named `data` and `output`.\n\n2. **Download** the Department of Homeland Security's annual count of people granted refugee status between 2006-2015:\n\n   [{{< fa file-csv >}} DHS refugees, 2006-2015](/files/data/external_data/refugee_status.csv)\n    \n   Place this in the `data` subfolder you created in step 1.

There is data for 60 countries over 10 years, so you'll probably need to aggregate or reshape the data somehow (unless you do a 60-country sparkline).\n\n7. **Create** an appropriate time-based visualization based on the data. I've shown a few different ways to summarize the data so that it's plottable down below.

Because the emphasis for this assignment is on design, not code, I've provided code to help you clean up the data.\n\nThese are the main issues with the data:\n\n- There are non-numeric values in the data, like `-`, `X`, and `D`. The data isn't very well documented; I'm assuming `-` indicates a missing value, but I'm not sure what `X` and `D` mean, so for this assignment, we'll just assume they're also missing. \n\n- The data generally includes rows for dozens of countries, but there are also rows for some continents, \"unknown,\" \"other,\" and a total row. Because [Africa is not a country](https://twitter.com/africasacountry), and neither are the other continents, we want to exclude all non-countries.\n\n- Maintaining consistent country names across different datasets is *literally* the woooooooorst. Countries have different formal official names and datasets are never consistent in how they use those names.[^names] It's such a tricky problem that social scientists have spent their careers just figuring out how to properly name and code countries. Really.[^ccodes] There are international standards for country codes, though, like [ISO 3166-1 alpha 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) (my favorite), also known as ISO3. It's not perfect—it omits microstates (some Polynesian countries) and gray area states (Palestine, Kosovo)—but it's an international standard, so it has that going for it.\n\n- To ensure that country names are consistent in this data, we use the {countrycode} package (install it if you don't have it), which is amazing. The `countrycode()` function will take a country name in a given coding scheme and convert it to a different coding scheme using this syntax:\n\n  ```r\n  countrycode(variable, \"current-coding-scheme\", \"new-coding-scheme\")\n  ```\n\n  It also does a farily good job at guessing and parsing inconsistent country names (e.g. it will recognize \"Congo, Democratic Republic\", even though it should technically be \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\"). Here, we use `countrycode()` to convert the inconsistent country names into ISO3 codes. We then create a cleaner version of the `origin_country` column by converting the ISO3 codes back into country names. Note that the function chokes on North Korea initially, since it's included as \"Korea, North\"—we use the `custom_match` argument to help the function out.\n\n- The data isn't tidy—there are individual columns for each year. `gather()` takes every column and changes it to a row. We exclude the country, region, continent, and ISO3 code from the change-into-rows transformation with `-origin_country, -iso3, -origin_region, -origin_continent`.\n\n- Currently, the year is being treated as a number, but it's helpful to also treat it as an actual date. We create a new variable named `year_date` that converts the raw number (e.g. 2009) into a date. The date needs to have at least a month, day, and year, so we actually convert it to January 1, 2009 with `ymd(paste0(year, \"-01-01\"))`.\n\n[^names]: For instance, \"North Korea\", \"Korea, North\", \"DPRK\", \"Korea, Democratic People's Republic of\", and \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\", and \"Korea (DPRK)\" are all perfectly normal versions of the country's name and you'll find them all in the wild.\n\n[^ccodes]: See Gleditsch, Kristian S. & Michael D.

You'll want to filter it and select specific countries, though—you won't really be able to plot 60 countries all at once unless you use sparklines.\n\n```{r show-refugees-countries-fake, eval=FALSE}\nrefugees_clean\n```\n\n```{r show-refugees-countries, echo=FALSE}\nrefugees_clean %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n### Cumulative country totals over time\n\nNote the `cumsum()` function—it calculates the cumulative sum of a column.\n\n```{r make-refugees-countries-cumulative}\nrefugees_countries_cumulative <- refugees_clean %>%\n  arrange(year_date) %>%\n  group_by(origin_country) %>%\n  mutate(cumulative_total = cumsum(number))\n```\n\n```{r show-refugees-countries-cumulative, echo=FALSE}\nrefugees_countries_cumulative %>%\n  arrange(origin_country) %>%\n  select(-origin_region) %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n### Continent totals over time\n\nNote the `na.rm = TRUE` argument in `sum()`. This makes R ignore any missing data when calculating the total. Without it, if R finds a missing value in the column, it will mark the final sum as `NA` too, which we don't want.\n\n```{r make-refugees-continents}\nrefugees_continents <- refugees_clean %>%\n  group_by(origin_continent, year_date) %>%\n  summarize(total = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n```{r show-refugees-continents, echo=FALSE}\nrefugees_continents %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n### Cumulative continent totals over time\n\nNote that there are two `group_by()` functions here. First we get the total number of refugees per continent per year, then we group by continent only to get the cumulative sum of refugees across continents.\n\n```{r make-refugees-continents-cumulative}\nrefugees_continents_cumulative <- refugees_clean %>%\n  group_by(origin_continent, year_date) %>%\n  summarize(total = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  arrange(year_date) %>%\n  group_by(origin_continent) %>%\n  mutate(cumulative_total = cumsum(total))\n```\n\n```{r show-refugees-continents-cumulative, echo=FALSE}\nrefugees_continents_cumulative %>%\n  arrange(origin_continent) %>%\n
