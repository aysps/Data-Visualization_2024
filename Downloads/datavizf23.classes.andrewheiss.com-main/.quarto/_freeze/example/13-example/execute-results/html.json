This is mostly just to give you a taste of different methods for visualizing text. It's by no means comprehensive, but it is well annotated and commented and should (hopefully) be easy to follow.\n\nIf you want to play with part-of-speech tagging, you can download an already-tagged version of *Little Women* here (you'll likely need to right click and choose \"Save Link As‚Ä¶\"):\n\n- [{{< fa file-csv >}} `little_women_tagged.csv`](/files/data/processed_data/little_women_tagged.csv)\n\nIf you want to see other examples of text visualizations with the {tidytext} package, check out some of these:\n\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Harry Potter Sentiment Analysis for Beginners](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/300624_8260952d1f0346969e65f41a97006bf5.html) (this uses [the {harrypotter} package](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/harrypotter), which you can install from GitHub (not from CRAN))\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Peer Christensen [\"Fair is foul, and foul is fair: a tidytext sentiment analysis of Shakespeare‚Äôs tragedies\"](https://peerchristensen.netlify.app/post/fair-is-foul-and-foul-is-fair-a-tidytext-entiment-analysis-of-shakespeare-s-tragedies/)\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [\"Tidy text, parts of speech, and unique words in the Bible\"](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/12/26/tidytext-pos-john/)\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [\"Tidy text, parts of speech, and unique words in the Qur'an\"](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/12/28/tidytext-pos-arabic/)\n\n\n## Live coding example\n\n<div class=\"ratio ratio-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YeyZp8Dw55g\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### Big differences from the video\n\nThis is a highly cleaned up version of the code from the video.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Get data\n\nFirst, as always, we'll load the libraries we'll be using:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # For ggplot, dplyr, etc.\nlibrary(tidytext)    # For neat text things\nlibrary(gutenbergr)  # For downloading books from Project Gutenberg\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe're going to use the {gutenbergr} package to download some books directly from Project Gutenberg. The IDs for these books come from the URLs at their website. For instance, [*Little Women* is book #514](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/514). We'll store these books as `*_raw` and then clean them up later.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 514 Little Women\nlittle_women_raw <- gutenberg_download(514, meta_fields = \"title\")\n\n# 1524 - Hamlet\n# 1532 - King Lear\n# 1533 - Macbeth\n# 1513 - Romeo and Juliet\ntragedies_raw <- gutenberg_download(c(1524, 1532, 1533, 1513),\n                                    meta_fields = \"title\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### Downloading errors\n\nSometimes the Project Gutenberg server gets too much traffic and goes down temporarily (it's all run by volunteers!) and you'll get an error like this:\n\n```default\nWarning: Could not download a book at http://aleph.gutenberg.org/...\n```\n\nProject Gutenberg has multiple copies of itself on different servers around the world, called \"mirrors.\" You can see [the full list of mirrors here](https://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL). If you get an error about connecting to the main Project Gutenberg server (aleph.gutenberg.org), you can specify a different mirror with the `mirror` argument in `gutenberg_download()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlittle_women_raw <- gutenberg_download(514, meta_fields = \"title\",\n                                       mirror = \"https://gutenberg.pglaf.org/\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nIf you won't want to redownload the books every time you knit (you don't), you can do the same trick we've used for [WDI](/example/08-example.qmd) and [FRED data](/example/11-example.qmd). Put the actual code for getting the books in a chunk with `eval=FALSE` on it and run it manually in RStudio when you want to get the data. Then you can write the downloaded data as a CSV file, and then load it invisibly from the CSV file when you knit:\n\n````\nI first download data from Project Gutenberg:\n\n```{{r get-book, eval=FALSE}}\nbooks_raw <- gutenberg_download(...)\n\nwrite_csv(books_raw, \"data/books_raw.csv\")\n```\n\n```{{r load-book-data-real, include=FALSE}}\nbooks_raw <- read_csv(\"data/books_raw.csv\")\n```\n\n````\n\n## Clean data\n\nThe data you get from Project Gutenberg comes in a tidy format, with a column for the book id, a column for the title, and a column for text. Sometimes this text column will be divided by lines in the book; sometimes it might be an entire page or paragraph or chapter. It all depends on how the book is formatted at Project Gutenberg.\n\nHere's what the start of our `little_women_raw` data looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(little_women_raw)\n## # A tibble: 6 √ó 3\n##   gutenberg_id text                   title       \n##          <int> <chr>                  <chr>       \n## 1          514 \"Little Women\"         Little Women\n## 2          514 \"\"                     Little Women\n## 3          514 \"by Louisa May Alcott\" Little Women\n## 4          514 \"\"                     Little Women\n## 5          514 \"\"                     Little Women\n## 6          514 \"Contents\"             Little Women\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we look at the data in RStudio, we can see that the actual book doesn't start until row 70 (the first 69 rows are the table of contents and other parts of the front matter).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Every book is different!\n\nIn this case, *Little Women* starts at row 67. **That will not be true for all books!** Every book is unique and has different amounts of front matter. You cannot assume that any book you work with starts at line 67.\n:::\n\nIt would be nice if we had a column that indicated what chapter each line is in, since we could then group by chapter and look at patterns within chapters. Since the data doesn't come with a chapter column, we have to make one ourselves using a fun little trick. Each chapter in the book starts with \"CHAPTER ONE\" or \"CHAPTER TWO\", with \"chapter\" in ALL CAPS. We can make a variable named `chapter_start` that will be true if a line starts with \"CHAPTER\" and false if not. Then we can use the `cumsum()` function to take the cumulative sum of this column, which will increment up one number ever time there's a new chapter, thus creating a helpful chapter column.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Clean up Little Women\nlittle_women <- little_women_raw %>% \n  # The actual book doesn't start until line 67\n  slice(67:n()) %>% \n  # Get rid of rows where text is missing\n  drop_na(text) %>% \n  # Chapters start with CHAPTER X, so mark if each row is a chapter start\n  # cumsum() calculates the cumulative sum, so it'll increase every time there's\n  # a new chapter and automatically make chapter numbers\n  mutate(chapter_start = str_detect(text, \"^CHAPTER\"),\n         chapter_number = cumsum(chapter_start)) %>% \n  # Get rid of these columns\n  select(-gutenberg_id, -title, -chapter_start)\n\nhead(little_women)\n## # A tibble: 6 √ó 2\n##   text                                                                      chapter_number\n##   <chr>                                                                              <int>\n## 1 \"CHAPTER ONE\"                                                                          1\n## 2 \"PLAYING PILGRIMS\"                                                                     1\n## 3 \"\"                                                                                     1\n## 4 \"\"                                                                                     1\n## 5 \"‚ÄúChristmas won‚Äôt be Christmas without any presents,‚Äù grumbled Jo, lying\"              1\n## 6 \"on the rug.\"                                                                          1\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data from Shakespeare is similarly messy, with just three columns:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(tragedies_raw)\n## # A tibble: 6 √ó 3\n##   gutenberg_id text                              title           \n##          <int> <chr>                             <chr>           \n## 1         1513 \"THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET\" Romeo and Juliet\n## 2         1513 \"\"                                Romeo and Juliet\n## 3         1513 \"\"                                Romeo and Juliet\n## 4         1513 \"\"                                Romeo and Juliet\n## 5         1513 \"by William Shakespeare\"          Romeo and Juliet\n## 6         1513 \"\"                                Romeo and Juliet\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe initial text sometimes isn't the actual text of the book. If you look at the beginning of *Hamlet*, for instance, there's a bunch of introductory stuff from editors and transcribers. In real life, we'd want to find a systematic way to get rid of that (perhaps by looking at how many introductory rows there are in each of the four plays and removing those rows), but for now, we'll just live with it and pretend Shakespeare wrote these notes. ü§∑\n\nWe could also figure out a systematic way to indicate acts and scenes, but that's tricky, so we won't for this example. ([This guy did though!](https://peerchristensen.netlify.app/post/fair-is-foul-and-foul-is-fair-a-tidytext-entiment-analysis-of-shakespeare-s-tragedies/))\n\nNow that we have tidy text data, let's do stuff with it!\n\n\n## Tokens and word counts\n\n### Single words\n\nOne way we can visualize text is to look at word frequencies and find the most common words. This is even more important when looking across documents. \n\nRight now the text we have is tidy, but it is based on lines of text, not words. In order to count words correctly, we need each token (or text element, whether it be a word or bigram or paragraph or whatever) to be in its own row. The `unnest_tokens()` functions from {tidytext} does this for us. The first argument is the name of the column we want to create; the second argument is the name of the column we want to split into tokens.\n\nLet's just work with the Shakespeare tragedies:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntragedies_words <- tragedies_raw %>% \n  drop_na(text) %>% \n  unnest_tokens(word, text)\n\nhead(tragedies_words)\n## # A tibble: 6 √ó 3\n##   gutenberg_id title            word   \n##          <int> <chr>            <chr>  \n## 1         1513 Romeo and Juliet the    \n## 2         1513 Romeo and Juliet tragedy\n## 3         1513 Romeo and Juliet of     \n## 4         1513 Romeo and Juliet romeo  \n## 5         1513 Romeo and Juliet and    \n## 6         1513 Romeo and Juliet juliet\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have words, we can filter and count the words. Here's what's happening in this next chunk:\n\n- We use `anti_join()` to remove all common stop words like \"a\" and \"the\" that are listed in the `stop_words` dataset that is loaded when you load {tidytext}\n- We count how many times each word appears in each title/play\n- We only keep the top 15 words\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_words_tragedies <- tragedies_words %>% \n  # Remove stop words\n  anti_join(stop_words) %>% \n  # Get rid of old timey words and stage directions\n  filter(!(word %in% c(\"thou\", \"thy\", \"haue\", \"thee\", \n                      \"thine\", \"enter\", \"exeunt\", \"exit\"))) %>% \n  # Count all the words in each play\n  count(title, word, sort = TRUE) %>% \n  # Keep top 15 in each play\n  group_by(title) %>% \n  top_n(15) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  # Make the words an ordered factor so they plot in order\n  mutate(word = fct_inorder(word))\ntop_words_tragedies\n## # A tibble: 62 √ó 3\n##    title                     word           n\n##    <chr>                     <fct>      <int>\n##  1 Hamlet, Prince of Denmark hamlet       461\n##  2 Romeo and Juliet          romeo        300\n##  3 Macbeth                   macbeth      282\n##  4 The Tragedy of King Lear  lear         229\n##  5 Hamlet, Prince of Denmark lord         223\n##  6 Hamlet, Prince of Denmark king         196\n##  7 Romeo and Juliet          juliet       178\n##  8 The Tragedy of King Lear  kent         170\n##  9 The Tragedy of King Lear  gloucester   169\n## 10 Hamlet, Prince of Denmark horatio      156\n## # ‚Ñπ 52 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can plot these results, facetting and filling by title:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(top_words_tragedies, aes(y = fct_rev(word), x = n, fill = title)) + \n  geom_col() + \n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  labs(y = \"Count\", x = NULL, \n       title = \"15 most frequent words in four Shakespearean tragedies\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(title), scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-example_files/figure-html/plot-top-words-tragedies-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese results aren't terribly surprising. \"lear\" is the most common word in *King Lear*, \"macbeth\" is the most common word in *Macbeth*, and so on. But the results are still really neat! This is a wordcloud for grownups!\n\n(Sharp-eyed readers will notice that the words aren't actually in perfect order! That's because some common words are repeated across the plays, like \"lord\" and \"sir\". However, each category in a factor can only have one possible position in the orer, so because \"lord\" is the second most common word in *Hamlet* it also appears as #2 in *Macbeth* and *King Lear*. You can fix this with the `reorder_within()` function in {tidytext}‚Äîsee [Julia Silge's tutorial here](https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/) for how to use it.)\n\n### Bigrams\n\nWe can also look at pairs of words instead of single words. To do this, we need to change a couple arguments in `unnest_tokens()`, but otherwise everything else stays the same. In order to remove stopwords, we need to split the bigram column into two columns (`word1` and `word2`) with `separate()`, filter each of those columns, and then combine the word columns back together as `bigram` with `unite()`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntragedies_bigrams <- tragedies_raw %>% \n  drop_na(text) %>% \n  # n = 2 here means bigrams.

In this graph, I replaced the x-axis labels with \"2x\" and \"4x\", but without those, you get numbers like 1, 2, and 3 (or -1, -2, -3)).

Oh well.\n\n\n## Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)\n\nWe can determine which words are the most unique for each book/document in our corpus using by calculating the tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) score for each term. The tf-idf is the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{tf}(\\text{term}) &= \\frac{n_{\\text{term}}}{n_{\\text{terms in document}}} \\\\\n\\operatorname{idf}(\\text{term}) &= \\ln{\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{documents}}}{n_{\\text{documents containing term}}}\\right)} \\\\\n\\operatorname{tf-idf}(\\text{term}) &= \\operatorname{tf}(\\text{term}) \\times \\operatorname{idf}(\\text{term})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFortunately you don't need to remember that formula. The `bind_tf_idf()` function will calculate this for you. Remember, the higher the tf-idf number, the more unique the term is in the document, but these numbers are meaningless and unitless‚Äîyou can't convert them to a percentage or anything.\n\nHere are the most unique words in these four tragedies, compared to all the tragedies:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntragedy_words <- tragedies_raw %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  # Split into word tokens\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% \n  # Remove stop words and old timey words\n  anti_join(stop_words) %>% \n  filter(!word %in% c(\"thou\", \"thy\", \"haue\", \"thee\", \n                      \"thine\", \"enter\", \"exeunt\", \"exit\")) %>% \n  count(title, word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# Add the tf-idf values to the counts\ntragedy_tf_idf <- tragedy_words %>% \n  bind_tf_idf(word, title, n)\n\n# Get the top 10 uniquest words\ntragedy_tf_idf_plot <- tragedy_tf_idf %>% \n  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% \n  group_by(title) %>% \n  top_n(10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(word = fct_inorder(word))\n\nggplot(tragedy_tf_idf_plot, \n       aes(y = fct_rev(word), x = tf_idf, fill = title)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"tf-idf\", y = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ title, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-example_files/figure-html/tf-idf-tragedies-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the most unique words for each play happen to be the names of the characters in those plays.\n\n\n## Sentiment analysis\n\nIn the video, I plotted the sentiment of *Little Women* across the book, but it wasn't a very interesting plot. We'll try with Shakespeare here instead. \n\nAt its core, sentiment analysis involves looking at a big list of words for how negative or positive they are. Some sentiment dictionaries mark if a word is \"negative\" or \"positive\"; some give words a score from -3 to 3; some give different emotions like \"sadness\" or \"anger\". You can see what the different dictionaries look like with `get_sentiments()`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_sentiments(\"afinn\")  # Scoring system\n## # A tibble: 2,477 √ó 2\n##    word       value\n##    <chr>      <dbl>\n##  1 abandon       -2\n##  2 abandoned     -2\n##  3 abandons      -2\n##  4 abducted      -2\n##  5 abduction     -2\n##  6 abductions    -2\n##  7 abhor         -3\n##  8 abhorred      -3\n##  9 abhorrent     -3\n## 10 abhors        -3\n## # ‚Ñπ 2,467 more rows\n# get_sentiments(\"bing\")  # Negative/positive\n# get_sentiments(\"nrc\")  # Specific emotions\n# get_sentiments(\"loughran\")  # Designed for financial statements; positive/negative\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere we split the Shakespearean tragedies into words, join a sentiment dictionary to it, and use {dplyr} data wrangling to calculate the net number positive words in each chapter. Had we used the AFINN library, we could calculate the average sentiment per chapter, since AFINN uses a scoring system instead of negative/positive labels. Or we could've used the NRC library, which has specific emotions like trust and fear.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntragedy_words <- tragedies_raw %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  # Split into word tokens\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% \n  # Remove stop words and old timey words\n  anti_join(stop_words) %>% \n  filter(!word %in% c(\"thou\", \"thy\", \"haue\", \"thee\", \n                      \"thine\", \"enter\", \"exeunt\", \"exit\"))\n\n# Join the sentiment dictionary \ntragedy_sentiment <- tragedy_words %>% \n  inner_join(get_sentiments(\"bing\"), relationship = \"many-to-many\")\ntragedy_sentiment\n## # A tibble: 7,637 √ó 4\n##    gutenberg_id title            word       sentiment\n##           <int> <chr>            <chr>      <chr>    \n##  1         1513 Romeo and Juliet tragedy    negative \n##  2         1513 Romeo and Juliet dignity    positive \n##  3         1513 Romeo and Juliet fair       positive \n##  4         1513 Romeo and Juliet grudge     negative \n##  5         1513 Romeo and Juliet break      negative \n##  6         1513 Romeo and Juliet unclean    negative \n##  7         1513 Romeo and Juliet fatal      negative \n##  8         1513 Romeo and Juliet overthrows negative \n##  9         1513 Romeo and Juliet death      negative \n## 10         1513 Romeo and Juliet strife     negative \n## # ‚Ñπ 7,627 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can look at these sentiments a few different ways.

By splitting the data into groups of lines, we can show a more granular view of the progression of the plot. To do this we make a column that indicates the row number, and then we use the special `%/%` operator to perform integer division, which essentially lops off the decimal point when dividing numbers: 150/100 normally is 1.5, but in integer divison, it is 1. This is a helpful trick for putting rows 1-99 in one group, then rows 100-199 in another group, etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntragedies_split_into_lines <- tragedy_sentiment %>% \n  # Divide lines into groups of 100\n  mutate(line = row_number(),\n         line_chunk = line %/% 100) %>% \n  # Get a count of postiive and negative words in each 100-line chunk in each play\n  count(title, line_chunk, sentiment) %>% \n  # Convert the sentiment column into two columns named \"positive\" and \"negative\"\n  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n) %>% \n  # Calculate net sentiment\n  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)\n\nggplot(tragedies_split_into_lines,\n       aes(x = line_chunk, y = sentiment, fill = sentiment)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"magma\", end = 0.9) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(title), scales = \"free_x\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-example_files/figure-html/shakespeare-sentiment-plot-lines-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNeat. They're all really sad and negative, except for the beginning of Romeo and Juliet where the two lovers meet and fall in love. Then everyone dies later.\n\n\n## Neat extra stuff\n\nNone of this stuff was in the video, but it's useful to know and see how to do it. It all generally comes from the [*Tidy Text Mining* book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by Julia Silge and David Robinson\n\n### Part of speech tagging\n\nR has no way of knowing if words are nouns, verbs, or adjectives. You can algorithmically predict what part of speech each word is using a part-of-speech tagger, like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) or [Stanford's Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) library](https://nlp.stanford.edu/). \n\nThese are external programs that are not written in R and don't naturally communicate with R (spaCy is written in Python; Stanford's CoreNLP is written in Java). There is a helpful R package named {cleanNLP} that helps you interact with these programs from within R, whis is super helpful. {cleanNLP} also comes with its own R-only tagger so you don't need to install anything with Python or Java (however, it's not as powerful as either spaCy, which is faster, and doesn't deal with foreign languages like Arabic and Chinese like Stanford's NLP library).\n\nYou can see other examples of part-of-speech tagging (along with instructions for how to install spaCy and coreNLP) here:\n\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [\"Tidy text, parts of speech, and unique words in the Bible\"](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/12/26/tidytext-pos-john/)\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [\"Tidy text, parts of speech, and unique words in the Qur'an\"](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2018/12/28/tidytext-pos-arabic/)\n\nHere's the general process for tagging (or \"annotating\") text with the {cleanNLP} package:\n\n1. Make a dataset where one column is the id (line number, chapter number, book+chapter, etc.), and another column is the text itself.\n\n2. Initialize the NLP tagger. You can use any of these:\n\n    - `cnlp_init_udpipe()`: Use an R-only tagger that should work without installing anything extra (a little slower than the others, but requires no extra steps!)\n    - `cnlp_init_spacy()`: Use spaCy (if you've installed it on your computer with Python)\n    - `cnlp_init_corenlp()`: Use Stanford's NLP library (if you've installed it on your computer with Java) \n\n3. Feed the data frame from step 1 into the `cnlp_annotate()` function and wait.\n\n4. Save the tagged data on your computer so you don't have to re-tag it every time.\n\nHere's an example using the *Little Women* data:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For the tagger to work, each row needs to be unique, which means we need to\n# combine all the text into individual chapter-based rows.
