The St. Louis Fed is in charge of publishing Fed economic data, and they host it all at an online portal named [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). Instead of downloading individual time series data from the FRED website, we'll do what with did with the World Bank WDI data and download it directly from the internet with the [{tidyquant} package](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/), which includes a function for working with the FRED API/website.\n\nIf you want to skip the data downloading, you can download the data below (you'll likely need to right click and choose \"Save Link As…\"):\n\n- [{{< fa file-csv >}} `fred_raw.csv`](/files/data/processed_data/fred.csv)\n\n\n## Live coding example\n\n<div class=\"ratio ratio-16x9\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObnRqO4zTY8\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### Slight differences from the video\n\nThis is a slightly cleaned up version of the code from the video.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Get data\n\nFirst, we load the libraries we'll be using:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For ggplot, dplyr, and friends\nlibrary(tidyquant)  # For accessing FRED data\nlibrary(scales)     # For nicer labels\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe US Federal Reserve provides thousands of economic datasets at [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). We can use the [{tidyquant} R package](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/) to access their servers and download the data directly into R.\n\nLike we did with the [WDI indicators in session 8](/example/08-example.qmd), we need to find the special internal code for the variables we want to get. We need to pay close attention to the details of each variable, since the same measure can be offered with different combinations of real (adjusted for inflation) or nominal (not adjusted for inflation); monthly, quarterly, or annually; and seasonally adjusted or not seasonally adjusted. For instance, if you want to see US GDP, here are some possibilities (all the possible GDP measures are [listed here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/106)):\n\n- [`GDPC1`: Real (2012 dollars), quarterly, seasonally adjusted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1)\n- [`ND000334Q`: Real (2012 dollars), quarterly, not seasonally adjusted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ND000334Q)\n- [`GDPCA`: Real (2012 dollars), annual, not seasonally adjusted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPCA)\n- [`GDP`: Nominal, quarterly, seasonally adjusted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)\n- [`GDPA`: Nominal, annual, not seasonally adjusted](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPA)\n\nThe code for getting data from FRED works a little differently than `WDI()`, and the output is a little different too, but it's hopefully not too complicated. We need to feed the `tq_get()` function (1) a list of indicators we want, (2) a source for those indicators, and (3) a starting and/or ending date.\n\n`tq_get()` can actually get data from a ton of different sources like stocks from Yahoo Finance and general financial data from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal), [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), and [Tiingo](https://api.tiingo.com/). Most of those other sources require a subscription and a fancy API key that logs you into their servers when getting data, but FRED is free (yay public goods!).\n\nWe'll first make a new dataset named `fred_raw` that gets a bunch of interesting variables from FRED from January 1, 1990 until today.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfred_raw <- tq_get(c(\"RSXFSN\",  # Advance retail sales\n                     \"GDPC1\",  # GDP\n                     \"ICSA\",  # Initial unemployment claims\n                     \"FPCPITOTLZGUSA\",  # Inflation\n                     \"UNRATE\",  # Unemployment rate\n                     \"USREC\"),  # Recessions\n                   get = \"economic.data\",  # Use FRED\n                   from = \"1990-01-01\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nDownloading data from FRED every time you knit will get tedious and take a long time (plus if their servers are temporarily down, you won't be able to get the data). As with the World Bank data we used, it's good practice to save this raw data as a CSV file and then work with that.\n\nSince we care about reproducibility, we still want to include the code we used to get data from FRED, we just don't want it to actually run. You can include chunks but not run them by setting `eval=FALSE` in the chunk options. In this little example, we show the code for downloading the data, but we don't evaluate the chunk. We then include a chunk that loads the data from a CSV file with `read_csv()`, but we don't include it (`include=FALSE`). That way, in the knitted file we see the `WDI()` code, but in reality it's loading the data from CSV. Super tricky.\n\n````markdown\nI first download data from FRED:\n\n```{{r get-fred-data, eval=FALSE}}\nfred_raw <- tq_get(...)\n\nwrite_csv(fred_raw, \"data/fred_raw.csv\")\n```\n\n```{{r load-fred-data-real, include=FALSE}}\nfred_raw <- read_csv(\"data/fred_raw.csv\")\n```\n\n````\n\n\n\n\n\n## Look at and clean data\n\nThe data we get from FRED is in a slightly different format than we're used to with `WDI()`, but with good reason. With World Bank data, you get data for every country and every year, so there are rows for Afghanistan 2000, Afghanistan 2001, etc. You then get a column for each of the variables you want (population, life expectancy, GDP/capita, etc.)\n\nWith FRED data, that kind of format doesn't work for every possible time series variable because time is spaced differently. If you want to work with annual GDP, you should have a row for each year. If you want quarterly GDP, you should have a row for every quarter. If you put these in the same dataset, you'll end up with all sorts of missing data issues:\n\n| `time`   | `annual_gdp` | `quarterly_gdp` |\n| -------- | :----------: | :-------------: |\n| 2019, Q1 |      X       |        X        |\n| 2019, Q2 |              |        X        |\n| 2019, Q3 |              |        X        |\n| 2019, Q4 |              |        X        |\n| 2020, Q1 |      X       |        X        |\n| 2020, Q2 |              |        X        |\n\nTo fix this, the {tidyquant} package gives you data in tidy (or long) form and only provides three columns:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(fred_raw)\n## # A tibble: 6 × 3\n##   symbol date        price\n##   <chr>  <date>      <dbl>\n## 1 RSXFSN 1992-01-01 130683\n## 2 RSXFSN 1992-02-01 131244\n## 3 RSXFSN 1992-03-01 142488\n## 4 RSXFSN 1992-04-01 147175\n## 5 RSXFSN 1992-05-01 152420\n## 6 RSXFSN 1992-06-01 151849\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `symbol` column is the ID of the variable from FRED , `date` is… the date, and `price` is the value. These columns are called symbol and price because the {tidyquant} package was designed to get and process stock data, so you'd typically see stock symbols (like AAPL or MSFT) and stock prices. When working with FRED data, the `price` column shows the value of whatever you're interested in—it's not technically a price (so unemployment claims, inflation rates, and GDP values are still called `price`).\n\nRight now, our `fred_raw` dataset has only 3 columns, but nearly 3,000 rows since the six indicators we got from the server are all stacked on top of each other. To actually work with these, we need to filter the raw data so that it only includes the indicators we're interested in. For instance, if we want to plot retail sales, we need to select only the rows where the symbol is `RSXFSN`. Make a smaller dataset with `filter()` to do that:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nretail_sales <- fred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol == \"RSXFSN\")\n\nretail_sales\n## # A tibble: 383 × 3\n##    symbol date        price\n##    <chr>  <date>      <dbl>\n##  1 RSXFSN 1992-01-01 130683\n##  2 RSXFSN 1992-02-01 131244\n##  3 RSXFSN 1992-03-01 142488\n##  4 RSXFSN 1992-04-01 147175\n##  5 RSXFSN 1992-05-01 152420\n##  6 RSXFSN 1992-06-01 151849\n##  7 RSXFSN 1992-07-01 152586\n##  8 RSXFSN 1992-08-01 152476\n##  9 RSXFSN 1992-09-01 148158\n## 10 RSXFSN 1992-10-01 155987\n## # ℹ 373 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf multiple variables have the same spacing (annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly), you can use filter to select all of them and then the use `pivot_wider()` or `spread()` to make separate columns for each. Inflation, unemployment, and retail sales are all monthly, so we can make a dataset for just those:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfred_monthly_things <- fred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol %in% c(\"FPCPITOTLZGUSA\", \"UNRATE\", \"RSXFSN\")) %>% \n  # Convert the symbol column into multiple columns, using the \"prices\" for values\n  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = price)\n\nfred_monthly_things\n## # A tibble: 408 × 4\n##    date       RSXFSN FPCPITOTLZGUSA UNRATE\n##    <date>      <dbl>          <dbl>  <dbl>\n##  1 1992-01-01 130683           3.03    7.3\n##  2 1992-02-01 131244          NA       7.4\n##  3 1992-03-01 142488          NA       7.4\n##  4 1992-04-01 147175          NA       7.4\n##  5 1992-05-01 152420          NA       7.6\n##  6 1992-06-01 151849          NA       7.8\n##  7 1992-07-01 152586          NA       7.7\n##  8 1992-08-01 152476          NA       7.6\n##  9 1992-09-01 148158          NA       7.6\n## 10 1992-10-01 155987          NA       7.3\n## # ℹ 398 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut wait! There's a problem! The inflation rate we got isn't actually monthly—it seems to be annual, which explains all the `NA`s. Let's fix it by not including it. We'll also rename the columns so they're easier to work with\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfred_monthly_things <- fred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol %in% c(\"UNRATE\", \"RSXFSN\")) %>% \n  # Convert the symbol column into multiple columns, using the \"prices\" for values\n  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = price) %>% \n  rename(unemployment = UNRATE, retail_sales = RSXFSN)\n\nfred_monthly_things\n## # A tibble: 408 × 3\n##    date       retail_sales unemployment\n##    <date>            <dbl>        <dbl>\n##  1 1992-01-01       130683          7.3\n##  2 1992-02-01       131244          7.4\n##  3 1992-03-01       142488          7.4\n##  4 1992-04-01       147175          7.4\n##  5 1992-05-01       152420          7.6\n##  6 1992-06-01       151849          7.8\n##  7 1992-07-01       152586          7.7\n##  8 1992-08-01       152476          7.6\n##  9 1992-09-01       148158          7.6\n## 10 1992-10-01       155987          7.3\n## # ℹ 398 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nAll better.\n\nWe can make as many subsets of the long, tidy, raw data as we want.\n\n\n## Plotting time\n\nLet's plot some of these and see what the trends look like.

We can add one additional layer of information onto the plot and highlight when recessions start and end. We included a recessions variable (`USREC`) when we got data from FRED, so let's see what it looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol == \"USREC\")\n## # A tibble: 408 × 3\n##    symbol date       price\n##    <chr>  <date>     <dbl>\n##  1 USREC  1990-01-01     0\n##  2 USREC  1990-02-01     0\n##  3 USREC  1990-03-01     0\n##  4 USREC  1990-04-01     0\n##  5 USREC  1990-05-01     0\n##  6 USREC  1990-06-01     0\n##  7 USREC  1990-07-01     0\n##  8 USREC  1990-08-01     1\n##  9 USREC  1990-09-01     1\n## 10 USREC  1990-10-01     1\n## # ℹ 398 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is monthly data that shows a 1 if we were in a recession that month and a 0 if we weren't. The Fed doesn't decide when recessions happen—the [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](https://www.nber.org/) does, and they have [specific guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession#Definition) for defining one. We're probably in one right now, but there's not enough data for NBER to formally declare it yet.\n\nThis data is long and tidy, but that makes it harder to work with given our GDP. We want the start and end dates for each recession so that we can shade those areas on the plot. To find those dates, we need to do a little data reshaping. First, we'll create a temporary variable that marks if there was a switch from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 in a given row by looking at the previous row\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrecessions_tidy <- fred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol == \"USREC\") %>% \n  mutate(recession_change = price - lag(price))\nrecessions_tidy\n## # A tibble: 408 × 4\n##    symbol date       price recession_change\n##    <chr>  <date>     <dbl>            <dbl>\n##  1 USREC  1990-01-01     0               NA\n##  2 USREC  1990-02-01     0                0\n##  3 USREC  1990-03-01     0                0\n##  4 USREC  1990-04-01     0                0\n##  5 USREC  1990-05-01     0                0\n##  6 USREC  1990-06-01     0                0\n##  7 USREC  1990-07-01     0                0\n##  8 USREC  1990-08-01     1                1\n##  9 USREC  1990-09-01     1                0\n## 10 USREC  1990-10-01     1                0\n## # ℹ 398 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice the new column we have that is mostly 0s, but 1 when there's a switch, like in August 1990. 1 means we went from 0 to 1 (no recession → recession), while -1 means we went from 1 to 0 (recession → no recession).\n\nWe can see all the start and end dates if we filter:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrecessions_start_end <- fred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol == \"USREC\") %>% \n  mutate(recession_change = price - lag(price)) %>% \n  filter(recession_change != 0)\nrecessions_start_end\n## # A tibble: 8 × 4\n##   symbol date       price recession_change\n##   <chr>  <date>     <dbl>            <dbl>\n## 1 USREC  1990-08-01     1                1\n## 2 USREC  1991-04-01     0               -1\n## 3 USREC  2001-04-01     1                1\n## 4 USREC  2001-12-01     0               -1\n## 5 USREC  2008-01-01     1                1\n## 6 USREC  2009-07-01     0               -1\n## 7 USREC  2020-03-01     1                1\n## 8 USREC  2020-05-01     0               -1\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we can use `tibble()` to create a brand new little dataset row that includes columns for the start and end dates of each recession. We'll use a combination of `filter()` and `pull()` to extract the start dates (where `recession_change` is 1) and the end dates (where `recession_change` is −1), and then we'll stick those two vectors together in a data frame.\n\nIf you're creating this tiny dataset during an actual recession, though, you need to do a little extra step. If you're currently in a recession, the `recession_ends` vector will be one element shorted than the `recession_starts` vector, since the ongoing recession hasn't ended yet. We can check for this with code. If the `recession_ends` vector is shorter than `recesison_starts`, will stick an end date to the recession as `today()` (`today()` by itself returns regular text like `\"2023-11-01\"`; we need to tell R that this is a date by feeding it to `ymd()`)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pull out the start dates\nrecession_starts <- recessions_start_end %>% \n  filter(recession_change == 1) %>% \n  pull(date)\nrecession_starts\n## [1] \"1990-08-01\" \"2001-04-01\" \"2008-01-01\" \"2020-03-01\"\n\n# Pull out the end dates\nrecession_ends <- recessions_start_end %>% \n  filter(recession_change == -1) %>% \n  pull(date)\nrecession_ends\n## [1] \"1991-04-01\" \"2001-12-01\" \"2009-07-01\" \"2020-05-01\"\n\n# Check the length of `recession_ends` and append `today()` if it doesn't \n# match `recession_starts`\n#\n# If you're running this code not during a recession, there's no need for this\n# intermediate step, but it's good practice to include it just in case you run\n# this code in the future and you *are* in a recession\nif (length(recession_ends) < length(recession_starts)) {\n  recession_ends <- c(recession_ends, ymd(today()))\n}\n\n# Make a dataframe with the two vectors of start and end dates\nrecessions <- tibble(start = recession_starts,\n                     end = recession_ends)\nrecessions\n## # A tibble: 4 × 2\n##   start      end       \n##   <date>     <date>    \n## 1 1990-08-01 1991-04-01\n## 2 2001-04-01 2001-12-01\n## 3 2008-01-01 2009-07-01\n## 4 2020-03-01 2020-05-01\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now add this tiny dataset to our plot using `geom_rect()`. Notice how we put `geom_rect()` *before* `geom_line()`—that's so the recession rectangles go under the line instead of on top of it. Also notice that we have to specify 4 new aesthetics for `geom_rect()`: min and max values for both x and y. We use the recession start and end dates for `xmin` and `xmax`, and then use −∞ and ∞ for `ymin` and `ymax` to make the rectangles stretch from the bottom of the plot to the top.\n\nThe last odd/new thing here is that we also use `inherit.aes = FALSE` in `geom_rect()`. That's because we specified a global `x` and `y` aesthetic in `ggplot()`, which applies to all the other layers we add. `geom_rect()` doesn't use `x` or `y`, though, and it'll complain that those columns are missing. The `inherit.aes` argument tells ggplot that the `geom_rect()` layer should not get any of the global aesthetics like `x` or `y`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gdp_only, aes(x = date, y = price)) +\n  geom_rect(data = recessions, \n            aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf),\n            inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = \"#B10DC9\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#0074D9\", linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +\n  labs(y = \"Billions of 2012 dollars\",\n       x = NULL,\n       title = \"US Gross Domestic Product\",\n       subtitle = \"Quarterly data; real 2012 dollars\",\n       caption = \"Source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis and FRED\") +\n  theme_bw(base_family = \"Roboto Condensed\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n## Warning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n\n## Warning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font family not found in Windows font database\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-example_files/figure-html/gdp-fancy-awesom-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nNow that we have the tiny recessions data frame, we can add it to any plot we want.

To do that, we need to first modify our little dataset and tell it to be a time-enabled data frame (a `tsibble`) that is indexed by the year+month for each row. We'll create a new column called `year_month` and then use `as_tsibble()` to tell R that this is really truly dealing with time:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tsibble)  # For embedding time things into data frames\n\nretail_sales <- fred_raw %>% \n  filter(symbol == \"RSXFSN\") %>% \n  mutate(year_month = yearmonth(date)) %>% \n  as_tsibble(index = year_month)\nretail_sales\n## # A tsibble: 383 x 4 [1M]\n##    symbol date        price year_month\n##    <chr>  <date>      <dbl>      <mth>\n##  1 RSXFSN 1992-01-01 130683   1992 Jan\n##  2 RSXFSN 1992-02-01 131244   1992 Feb\n##  3 RSXFSN 1992-03-01 142488   1992 Mar\n##  4 RSXFSN 1992-04-01 147175   1992 Apr\n##  5 RSXFSN 1992-05-01 152420   1992 May\n##  6 RSXFSN 1992-06-01 151849   1992 Jun\n##  7 RSXFSN 1992-07-01 152586   1992 Jul\n##  8 RSXFSN 1992-08-01 152476   1992 Aug\n##  9 RSXFSN 1992-09-01 148158   1992 Sep\n## 10 RSXFSN 1992-10-01 155987   1992 Oct\n## # ℹ 373 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that the `year_month` column is now just the year+month.

There are lots of different ways to model time series, and distinguishing between the different types is *way* beyond the scope of this class. [Rob Hyndman's free books covers them all](https://otexts.com/fpp3/).
