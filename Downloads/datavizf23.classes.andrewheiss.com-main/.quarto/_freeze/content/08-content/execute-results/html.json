Explanation of the differences between showing relative differences, absolute differences, and log ratios.\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Sparkline theory and practice](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR). This is a collection of posts by Edward Tufte about sparklines—scroll down a ways and check out his examples, analysis, and critiques.\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Time series sparklines](https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/02-time-series-sparklines-2/)\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Comparisons with lollipop charts](https://uc-r.github.io/lollipop). If you're feeling adventurous (and you should!), do this tutorial as you read it.\n\n### Reproducible examples\n\nReprexes (or reproducible examples) are the best way to (1) get help online and (2) fix issues on your own. \n\nMaking a good reprex is tricky, but it's a very valuable skill to know (regardless of programming language!). Here are some helpful resources for making them:\n\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [What's a reproducible example (`reprex`) and how do I do one?](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-do-one/5219)\n- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [So you've been asked to make a reprex](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/so-you-ve-been-asked-to-make-a-reprex/)\n- {{< fa brands r-project >}} [The reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html)\n\n### Possible questions to reflect on\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n#### This is not a required list!\n\nRemember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**\n:::\n\n- These readings all show a ton of new ways to present comparisons. Which ones are your favorite? Which ones didn't quite click with you? In what situations are some more appropriate than others?\n\n\n## Slides\n\nThe slides for this week's lesson are available online as an HTML file.
